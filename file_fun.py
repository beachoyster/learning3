#You will often hear nerds talking about io - input/output
#Your keyboard is an input, your mouse is an input, and you get
# output on screen and into saved files

#we'll do some input and output stuff with pyhton now

#uncomment the script below, run it and tell me what it does

#from sys import argv

#script, filename = argv

#print("opening the file")
#file = open(filename, 'w')

#print("Truncating the file! (Erasing everything")
#file.truncate()

#print("now I'm going to ask you to enter data into the file")

#line1 = input("line 1: ")
#line2 = input("line 2: ")
#line3 = input("line 3: ")

#print("I'm going to write these two the file")

#file.write(line1 + '\n')
#file.write(line2 + '\n')
#file.write(line3 + '\n')

#print("now we're closing the file")

#file.close()

#print("now we're going to re-open the file")

#file = open(filename, 'r')

#print("now we'll read the file")

#file_content = file.read()

#print(file_content)

# notice that when we open the file, we either open it to read or we open
# it to write. Look at the tomes we used the open() function in the program
# above. When did we use it to open the file for writing and when did we
# use it to open the file for reading? How did we signify to python that
# we were reading or writing?


# Have you ever copied and pasted a file from one folder to another?
# Let's write a program to do that


# in a new python file, write a program that
#   opens an existing file,
#   copies content of that file,
#   opens a new file
#   writes the content to the new file
#   and closes both files

#the program should also ask the user for the name of
#   the file they want to copy
#   the name of the new file they want to copy to
