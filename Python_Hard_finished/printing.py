#uncomment the code below and run it

# x = input("what kind of girl is honey?")
# y = "Honey is a %s girl!" % x
#print(y)

# y is a formatted string.


# make some more formatted strings.
#   %d is for numbers
#   %r shows data in its "original form" - try it




# Single and double quotes denote strings.
# How can you print a quote sign?
# you use escapes
# escapes are like this \

# print('\'')

# print Honey says "woof"!

# we define strings with single line functions
# What if you want to have a new line?
# you can use this kind of escape \n

#print ('look at \n this')

# print Honey
#        eats
#        oranges


# another way to show strings with multiple lines is to use triple quotes
# like this:

x = """ Once upon a time
I ate a whole frog
And it was entirely delicious"""

# print x


# make your own multi-line string and print it



# what if you want to print a tab?
# guess what, you can do it with \t
# print a tabbed string below



# but wait! if escapes (\) escape things, what do you do if you want
# to print a backslash?
# no worries, it's like escaping a quote (\")
# you can go "\\"
# print a bunch of backslashes below




# It's time to get raw input from people
# input("some question you want to ask: ") will print the string inside it
# and then let the user enter data from the console

#uncomment the below:

#x = input('What\'s up? ')
#print(x)

#write me a python program (in a separate py file) that asks for my age,
# weight, and how smelly I am
# make it print my responses
