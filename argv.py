#with python, you can create variables in one file
# and you can bring them into the file you're working in

#make a .py file and put a variable in there called x and give it a value
#import that variable into this file like this
#from %s import x   where %s is whatever file you created
#print x


#When you installed python, you got all lot of python software other people
#wrote
#You can use this software by importinging it
#when you import a file, python looks at the directory you're in
# and the directory all your python libraries are saved


# uncomment the code below

# from sys import argv

# script, user_name, first, second, third = argv

#print("The script is called:", script)
#print("Your computer user name is:" user_name)
#print("Your first variable is:", first)
#print("Your second variable is:", second)
#print("Your third variable is:", third)

#when you run this program in terminal type python argv.py ian is awesome


# what happened?


#sys lets you access global variables in your operating system
# like user_name as well as letting your user enter additional variables
# use argv to make a program that will let a user input what kind of girl
# honey is at terminal and then print it when the program runs
# I want to run the program from terminal like this
# "python yourprogram.py good"
