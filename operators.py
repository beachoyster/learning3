# 1. Above each line, use the # to write a comment to yourself explaining what the line does.


# 3. Find something you need to calculate and write a new .py ﬁ le that does it.


# 4. Notice tha the math seems wrong for some divisions? How can you represent a fraction in python?


# 5. Rewrite the code above to use ﬂoating point numbers so it’s more accurate (hint: 20.0 is ﬂoating point).
