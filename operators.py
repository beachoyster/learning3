#Above each line, use the # to write a comment to yourself explaining what the line does.
# 2. Remember in Exercise 0 when you started Python?
    # Start Python this way again and, using the above characters and what you know, use Python as a calculator.
# 3. Find something you need to calculate and write a new .py ﬁ le that does it.
# 4. Notice the math seems “wrong”?
    #There are no fractions, only whole numbers. Find out why by researching what a “ﬂ oating point” number is.
# 5. Rewrite ex3.py to use ﬂ oating point numbers so it’s more accurate (hint: 20.0 is ﬂ oating point).
